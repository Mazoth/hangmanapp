First application for the course "Apputvikling" which is part of the 
Computer Science bachelor programme during my third and last year of this grade.

I had 3 weeks to make this application, and through rigerous experimenting 
and improvisation I ended up with a end-result I'm quite happy with.

My teacher graded this application with an "A".
